#+begin_src bash
sam@devstation ~/hub/repos/NextJSShop $ npm install --save-dev tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

#+end_src

<2023-09-12 Tue 19:07>: Here is the command I used to initialize the Tailwind CSS config files:
#+begin_src bash
sam@devstation ~/hub/repos/NextJSShop $ npx tailwindcss init -p

Created Tailwind CSS config file: tailwind.config.js
Created PostCSS config file: postcss.config.js
#+end_src

After looking in the 'Questions' section for the lecture, I then used the 'content' option in the config file so that it now looks like this:
#+begin_src bash
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      backgroundImage: {
        'gradient-radial': 'radial-gradient(var(--tw-gradient-stops))',
        'gradient-conic':
          'conic-gradient(from 180deg at 50% 50%, var(--tw-gradient-stops))',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
export default config
#+end_src

<2023-09-12 Tue 19:15>: I then followed Step '4.' from the related link (), by adding the following to the 'globals.css' file:
#+begin_src css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
#+end_src
